_This is an attempt at digital gardening ([why](/posts/why-gardening/)). This garden was created with the help of [Pavel⇢](https://pa2sh.club/). This is a tool and a place. This garden uses `Call me Sam` theme for `Hugo` with minor changes ([github⇢](https://github.com/Sergei-Kalabin/hugo-theme-sam))_.
