I'm starting with the methodology outlined by Cristina M. Iosifescu Enescu in their work [Dream Cartography](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Dream-Cartography).

## To-Do:

* countryside: var. locations
* countryside: carved mountain, forest
* ruined desert city by the seaside
* ocean/river cliffs near Samara
* Berlin
* Texas
* flooded Samara: var. locations
* flooded city in the mountains
* Samara: var. iterations of (gravity anomaly, beast-mode)
* flood-meadows (gravity anomaly)
* my apt: var. scenarios
* jungle pool (fever)
* lamplit street (persuit by K.)
* cursed house (time anomaly: 40 years)
* random city (apt. blocks, topography)
* digital spaces: var. locations
