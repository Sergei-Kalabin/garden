The more beautiful and silent the things are, the more challenging they are to survive.

•
"Surviving amidst the Beauty" — Artiem, tour guide on a mountain hike. Described the mountain lake we camped at as a captivating but difficult spot to camp due to cold, lack of firewood, etc.

Space as the extrapolation of that. "A whole lot of nothing and nothing wants you dead" — Overly Sarcastic Productions on Space Horror.

•
Beauty and Nothing are relatives (how imortant is nothing in our perception of beauty)?
"God, I see how you love nothing. I love it too" — Book of Not.

•
My own musings on people who get devoted to beauty (even though the real-life example somewhat insporing this turned out to be temporary).
