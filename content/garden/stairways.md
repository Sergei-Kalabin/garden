*Notes on exclusively personal experience with stairways*

From my experience, moving only upwards is not justified and is impractical, sometimes even harmful.

A combination of upward, downward motions, and rest is required. Movement is non-linear: one usually navigates different sets of stairs simultaneously.


## ▟ Upward  

_Splendor / star damage_

* Fascination (until reversed)
* Coffee
* Knowledge
* Stories
* Taking notes
* Making beautiful things

## ▃ Landing

_Healing / plateau_

* Listening to subtle sounds
* Sketching out ideas
* Mending and arranging notes
* *Take a break. Breath in, breath out*

## ▙ Downward

_Softens the edge / strongest pull_

* Nicotine
* Victory by surrender
