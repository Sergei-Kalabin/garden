Symbolic system is a map, but also a labirynth.

## Symbols: Personal and less conventional

* ⊸Quest for obscure knowledge — _chasing ghosts and snippets of surreal truth in order to find something meaningful and sacred. Or salvation (though there is no such thing)._

* ⊸Sanatorium (for the dead) — _usually a place of healing, but in the case of dead entities, unable to heal from being dead, becomes a metaphor for a place of eternal rest or a lymbo for lingering ghosts._

* ⊸Tower Inverted — _Inversion is a common method of conveying crookedness or corruption of an object (see reversed cross). Taken at face value and not in Tarot sence, a Tower Inverted is bizzare architecture with an uncertain meaning (architectural codes signal constuction's meaning). It also becomes a form of a ⊸Well. A particular example of such well is an inverted tower or an **Initiation Well** in the [Quinta da Regaleira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinta_da_Regaleira) in Sintra, Portugal, used for mason initiations. I have descended it during my trip to Lisbon. Anna-Varney of Sopor Aeternus feat refers to Inverted Tower in her song_ [Little Velveteen Knight](https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858538611/) _as an "unnameable place" — a Dark Place of one's subconscious._
