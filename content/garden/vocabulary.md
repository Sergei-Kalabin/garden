Symbolic system is a map, but also a labirynth.

## Symbols: Part III

* Ascetic defence — _A form of camouflage. A practice of reducing oneself in order to mimic the inanimate world and hide from the prying and the tempting._

* Can't wake up _— ● Personal._

* ⊸Chair (empty) — _a symbol of a dead person's spirit and/or an opportunity to listen to what they have to say to mortals. A particular case is a_ **three-handled chair**: _a `dream` object, that human protagonist has trouble settling into because of the unusual ergonomics of three handles. Three-handlesness symbolises original owner's un-human, crooked nature (see: six fingered palm), in this dream – a demon (in a dream: namely Satan). A person trying to sit on it's chair was considered a claimant to it's powers and a challenger. ● Personal._

* ⊸Choir — _Enchances the message. Especially the one in your head. _

* Digital liminality / nostalgia — _digital spaces evoking longing and nostalgia due to a generation growing up in digital environments as much as physical ones. Particular case is the liminality of multiplayer maps played in singleplayer and devoid of any NPCs. See Source Engine games and PS1 Era games for reference._

* Dreaming — _I am used to having vivid and intricate dreams. This might actually be a reason why I have such a short REM phase? This in turn might explain why my brain resisted my lucid dreaming practices so much._

* [Dream cartography](/garden/dream-cartography) — _I have an interest in compiling a chart of dream spaces._

* Failure to do three — _Failure to make three things in a row is an attempt for immortality. ● Personal._

* ⊸a Fracture — _a type of opening. See_ ⊸Openings and closures. **A fracture / a perfect moment:**
_1 AM at my neighborhood.
I’m out for some late-night grocery.
Ghost-world blue windows of cardiac surgery.
Occasional tired passers-by on their own nocturnal adventures.
A pack of eight self-driving cars practicing their stops and turns.
A crisp feeling of sadness mixes with warm thoughts of people I’m blessed with.
Light pours in.
Light leaks out. ● Personal._

* Flooded streets — _a recurring `dream` setting: streets are flooded with water and require to traverse the city by swiming where one would normally walk. See works of Jared Pike for a Dream Pools twist on this theme._

* Glass tiles — _LIGHT LEAKS THROUGH, DISTORTED BUT BEAUTIFULL. ● Personal._

* ⊸Half-shaped heart — _One of the aspects of ⊸Transition. See [image⇢](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5lANxQi27A/) for reference. ●Personal._

* Hidden time — *Concept of concealed space applied to time, e.g. a Hidden Hour between one day and the next. Sometimes I stumble on my hidden minutes early in the moring, not yet completely awake. It feels like I'm dozing off for substantial time but in actuality only a minute passes.*

* ⊸House (the) — _⩍ → ⌂
Looking at doors for long enough eventually leads inside of the house.
Some houses have too many doors. ● Personal relationship with a conventional symbol._

* ⊸Infinite Hotel – _originally a thought experiment by  David Hilbert, but meaningful for me as a `dream` location. Had a dream about civilisations of humans surviving by scavenging in an infinite hotel building._

* Lack _of_ — _Truth exists as it is. It's the lies that are constructed._ 

* ⊸Light leaks through — _Yes. Openings and closures. ● Personal._

* ⊸Openings and closures — ① _Light leaks in and out of openings_
② _Resolved opening makes a closure_
③ _Closure is a reflection ●_
**Then again:**
① _Interaction happens through openings_
② _All openings are important_
③ _Some openings are wounds ●_
**Example:**
_Consumption/Proclamation – Vision/Wound_
**A memory:**
_There is a certain type of lighting I find “very Russian”. When the main light in a clouded scene is from the silver lining, but this edge is blinding. The kind of hope that doesn’t pretend to be anything more. No promises, only a reminder._
_I stroll around that pond but on an opposite season, disturbing the snow sprinkle. Is this the place? I don’t remember in truth._
_I remember sitting side by side, remember the rain and a single flimsy raincoat to cover, water all around. The ripple. The chills. The warmth of a smile. A cold summer day. And the light was very Russian._
_I snap out of this memory and stumble across some friends walking around. We get some coffee. The day goes on. ● Personal._

* Quest for obscure knowledge — _chasing ghosts and snippets of surreal truth in order to find something meaningful and sacred. Or salvation (though there is no such thing)._

* ⊸Sanatorium (for the dead) — _usually a place of healing, but in the case of dead entities, unable to heal from being dead, becomes a metaphor for a place of eternal rest or a lymbo for lingering ghosts. ● Personal_

* ⊸Star of Thorns — _Hope, stimulus. Merge of hardship with stars (as in: Per aspera ad astra). ● Personal_

* This — _this is ● Personal_

* ⊸Tower Inverted — _Inversion is a common method of conveying crookedness or corruption of an object (see reversed cross). Taken at face value and not in Tarot sence, a Tower Inverted is bizzare architecture with an uncertain meaning (architectural codes signal constuction's meaning). It also becomes a form of a ⊸Well. A particular example of such well is an inverted tower or an **Initiation Well** in the_ [Quinta da Regaleira⇢](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinta_da_Regaleira) _in Sintra, Portugal, used for mason initiations. I have descended it during my trip to Lisbon. Anna-Varney of Sopor Aeternus feat refers to Inverted Tower in her song_ [Little Velveteen Knight⇢](https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858538611/) _as an "unnameable place" — a Dark Place of one's subconscious._

* Tricksterdom — _Yet, buddy, watch that last step._

* ⊸[Know⇢](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18092344267086797/) _(in the)_ — _those on the same Quest as you, those who see the same Signs and chase the same Ghosts._
