## How to dress for work
The workshop is dominated by the `forge` aspects: fire and soot, grease and dirt. Transformations are usually based on bending and *persuasion* of the materials, so be ready for a struggle.

Wear darker colors to conseal stains, opt for denim for durability. I always advocate to avoid rags and to have a separate set of work clothes that you can wear with dignity – after all, you are an artisan.

Denim pants with denim chorecoat, black top and leather boots work best for me.
