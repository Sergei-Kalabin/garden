1. **Loner saved by connections subversion**
   Lonely characters in fiction often saved by the sudden connections they have or have maid during random encounters or through engaging in a non-loner scenarios (having a sibling, talking to strangers, lucky coincidence appearances of old connections, being thrown into communities by accident etc.) — thus already subverting the loner trope. 
   
   What could be a story of a true loner, subverting that subversion. To highlight the double subversion the MC often observes other loners in a regular trope — being helped by kind strangers or turning out to be not entirely lonely. But can never experience the same, because they are truly lonely.
   
   Character ideas:
   Ghost – Could be easy to explain inability to participate and restrain players from choosing the "break through" by restricting it on a plot/mechanical level.
   Just a lonely boi — Would need to invest into writing to explain inability to participate.
   
2. **Doom guys is a waiter and everyone is very civilised.**
   
3. Sleep Party Society (Sleepover Appreciation Club)
   A club of people looking for weird places to sleep at parties. The more unusual place the more points you score.
   Talk to unassuming party guests and other society members.
   Uncover LORE — an optional secret layer to the game with a romantic story behind the main plot.
   Cameo of Verge from the Dungeoneers.
