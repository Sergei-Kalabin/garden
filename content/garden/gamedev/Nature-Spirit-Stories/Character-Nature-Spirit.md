## Raw: Level 1

#### A
Here are a few potential ideas for why the [[Character - Human Child]] became a nature spirit:

1.  The boy was gravely injured while trying to protect the forest from a wildfire. As they lay dying, the spirits of the forest took pity on the boy and transformed them into a nature spirit, allowing them to continue protecting the forest in a new form.
    
2.  The boy was a skilled hunter who, in a moment of weakness, killed a deer in the forest. As punishment, the spirits of the forest took away the boy's human form and transformed them into a nature spirit, forcing them to live among the animals they had harmed and learn to respect and protect them.
    
3.  The boy was a young environmental activist who was killed while protesting against a logging company. As a reward for their dedication to protecting the forest, the spirits of the forest brought the boy back to life in the form of a nature spirit, allowing them to continue their fight for the forest in a new way.
    
4.  The boy was a devoted nature lover who spent most of their time in the forest. When they died of natural causes, the spirits of the forest saw their love for the forest and chose to bring the boy back as a nature spirit, allowing them to continue to be a part of the forest even after death.

#### Q
Come up with lore why spirits can't come up with stories. It should involve that the spirits lack creative spark for telling stories, because they are immortal, have no struggles like humans do and therefore have no perception of character development.

#### A
According to the lore of the game, spirits are eternal beings who exist outside of time and space. They are not subject to the same struggles and challenges that humans face, and as a result, they lack the creative spark that is necessary for telling stories.

Spirits are incapable of experiencing the same emotions and desires that drive human storytelling, such as love, loss, and conflict. Without these experiences, spirits are unable to understand the concept of character development or the importance of plot twists and turns.

Additionally, because spirits are immortal, they have no sense of mortality or the passage of time. This makes it difficult for them to understand the concept of a beginning, middle, and end, which are fundamental to the structure of most stories.

As a result, spirits are unable to come up with stories of their own, and must rely on the stories of humans to learn about the world and the creatures that inhabit it.

## Level 2

#### Q
Incorporate an extra plot twist: Turns out that before the human boy become a spirit, he was already unable to come up with stories. The reason is: sometimes children are born with a soul of a Watcher spirit â€” they serve as a vessel for the Watcher spirit and are very observant, they usually have wide eyes and see the true essence of things. But they can't tell stories, only observe and retell others. Because of that as humans they often feel outsiders and have difficulties to integrate into society. Tie this to how the boy died and turned into a nature spirit.

#### A
Here is a possible incorporation of the extra plot twist into the original plot:

In the game, the player takes on the role of a nature spirit who is tasked with taking care of the animals and plants in their forest pond domain. As the spirit goes about their daily chores, they regularly observe the humans who pass through their domain, listening to the stories they tell each other.

At first, the spirit is unable to come up with stories of their own, but over time they develop the ability to tell stories as well. The player must use this newfound ability to help the animals and plants in their domain, using the stories to inspire and guide them.

As the game progresses, the player learns that the spirit was once a human boy who was unable to come up with stories of his own. It is revealed that the boy was a "Watcher spirit," a rare type of person who is born with the soul of a Watcher spirit. These individuals are incredibly observant and can see the true essence of things, but they are unable to tell stories themselves.

As a result, the boy struggled to fit in with society and often felt like an outsider. This may have contributed to his eventual death and transformation into a nature spirit.

The player must use their newfound knowledge of the boy's past to help him overcome his inability to tell stories, and to use his unique abilities as a Watcher spirit to protect the forest and its inhabitants. The aim of the game is to use the spirit's storytelling abilities to help restore the forest to its former glory, and to protect it from the damaging effects of human activity.

#### Q
Suggest ideas how did the boy die with this information in mind.

#### A
Here are a few potential ideas for how the boy died, given his status as a Watcher spirit:

1.  The boy was bullied and ostracized by his peers for his inability to tell stories and his strange, otherworldly demeanor. One day, the bullying became too much for the boy to handle and he took his own life.
    
2.  The boy became isolated and depressed due to his struggles to fit in with society. He spent more and more time in the forest, seeking solace in the company of the animals and plants. One day, he wandered too far into the forest and was killed by a wild animal.
    
3.  The boy was killed while trying to protect the forest from a group of poachers who were hunting illegally. The boy's unique abilities as a Watcher spirit allowed him to see the poachers' true intentions, and he bravely stood up to them in order to protect the forest and its inhabitants.
    
4.  The boy was hit by a car while trying to save a injured bird that he had found on the side of the road. His sacrifice for the bird touched the spirits of the forest, and they chose to bring him back as a nature spirit in order to continue his work protecting the natural world.
