The following is an exrtract from **Calavert Journal** article:

> *When it comes to Reptsa, the name speaks for itself: a phonetic variation of “rebzya”, a Russian slang word meaning “friends/guys”. This is an occasional zine about loyalty, to your friends and to the place you live.*
> 
> *“I call it a ‘metamodernist hyperlocal zine’ where metamodernist means ‘genuine’. Some people create a cool buzz, but not all of them are really good people. But for me, that is what matters most – to be a good person first of all,” says Sergei Kalabin, the author of the zine.*
> 
> *The first edition consisted of only 15 copies printed for close friends, with texts and images which would be almost meaningless to the outside world. The current edition consists of 100 copies of papers and vinyl stickers, wrapped in black aluminium foil and polyethylene: exactly the way you would pack something fragile and precious.*
> 
> *Reptsa questions the status quo and focuses on something banal yet genuine that modern society risks missing out on: friendship.*
