`past`

Often Floods in my dreams

`present`

I've stepped into the Waters *of* Change

Got COVID â€” died symbolically, my breath burns

Made an extra empty bed in a spare room â€” one I usually keep for my Guests

Writhing in my cocoon, shedding my skin, preparing to be reborn

Connected over the World

I drank from the Waters *of* Change

â’¶ â†’ â–Ÿ

`future`
