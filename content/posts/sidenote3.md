Somewhere around 15 Dec. 2021 I have been waking up around `5 am` for a couple of nights. The sky behind the window was of terrifying orange color, so bright and toxic.

Later my insomniac patterns have changed — I was waking up around `1.5am` and `3 am` and then around `7 am `for a couple of days in Jan 2022. My fitness band only shows that for the 4th of Jan, but I'm sure it was more than that.

Now I'm drinking water and smoking, `12:30 am`. The night is ghostly green.

*P.S.
Funny thing — something's up with Hugo or Vercel server time? — this post is of 11 Jan by my local time, but it won't show until I change it back to 10th.*
