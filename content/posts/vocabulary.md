## Symbols: Less conventional

⊸Quest for obscure knowledge — _chasing ghosts and snippets of surreal truth in order to find something meaningful and sacred. Or salvation (though there is no such thing)._

⊸Sanatorium (for the dead) — _usually a place of healing, but in the case of dead entities, who can never heal from being dead, a place of eternal rest or a lymbo for lingering ghosts._

⊸Tower Inverted — _you get it?_

⊸[Know _(in the)_](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18092344267086797/) — _those on the same Quest as you, those who see the same Signs and chase the same Ghosts._
