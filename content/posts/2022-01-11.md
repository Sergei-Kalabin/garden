Somewhere around 15 dec. 2021 I have been waking up around `5am` for a couple of nights and the sky behind the window was of terrifying orange color, so bright and toxic.

Later my insomniac patterns have changed â€” I was waking up around `1.5am` and `3am` and then around `7am `for a couple of days in jan 2022. My handband only shows that for the 4th of jan, but I'm sure it was more then that.

Now I'm drinking water and smoking, `12:30 am`. The night is ghostly green.
