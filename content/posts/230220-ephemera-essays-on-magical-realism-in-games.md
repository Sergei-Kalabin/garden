# Ephemera Essays
Magical realism enchances how real things feel to us, making it more relatable than a realistic depiction. One could say that MR is a rather honest portrayal of what things really are on a conceptual(?)/emotional level.


Examples from video:
##### Kentucky Route Zero
People loose parts of themselves in exchange for something crucial, but unattainable, turning them into glowing yellow skeletons, limb by limb. Skeleton — hollow shell "living only to pay their debt", but pulsing neon yellow — high visibility.

##### Disco Elysium
Pale — subjectivity of history.

##### Control
Nucluar launch codes on a floppy are scary and dangerous. Motel is a liminal portal between different words and parts of our lives. Etc.
