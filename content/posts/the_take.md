The following is a transcript of a song **The Take/The Pace** from **16 colors** by **Veto**.

	Take another big bite of another piece of the cake
	If you never feel full then you know that you're on the take
	Take another big gulp and see if it fails to slake
	The first you have built and you know that you're on the take
	And then it'll be too late
	
	Try to slip out unseen, try to worm out like a snake
	If you've always come slithering back then you're on the take
	Make a really big racket announcing your great escape
	If you make up excuses and you know that you're on the take
	And then it'll be too late
		
	Take another big bite of another piece of the cake
	If you never feel full then you know that you're on the take
	Take another big gulp and see if it fails to slake
	The first you have built and you know that you're on the take
	And then it'll be too late (too late)
		
	The path of least resistance is the one that gets you through
	The more that you comply with it the easier for you
	The only thing you truly need is a simple set of rules
	The more you learn to live by them the more you can produce
	And the more you can reduce yourself to a simple interface
	The easier it is for you to keep up with the pace
