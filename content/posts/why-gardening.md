As a student I was always mesmerized by the academic research process. Later in life researching things has become an important part of my day job career and now it becomes a cornerstone of my art practice, on par with systematization, symbolism, world-building and narrative. 

Looking back at my social media habbits, it seems I have always leaned towards the work-with-the-garage-door-open approach.
