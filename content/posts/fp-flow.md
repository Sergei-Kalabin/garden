## _FLOW_
— how to get into the _zone_.

_ENJOYMENT_ from exerting skill and growth.

↓

via activity that `balances skill` and `challenge`, has `clear goals` and `immediate feedback`

↓

_IMMERSION_ in the task

1. Reduce EGO → admire external world;
2. Be mindful of the environment;
3. Use difficulties to find novel situations → provide enjoyable challenges.

_CHALLENGE_

* Should be aligned with personal goals
* Should be neither too difficult nor too easy
* Remain unaffected by external circumstances: both reward or punishment (??)

> _FLOW_ state is more often achieved THROUGH WORK than not.

the reward should be intrinsic, not external → • seeking new challenges and experience/knowledge
