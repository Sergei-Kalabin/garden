Aware of two such dreams — a slug and an earthworm, single long parasite under my skin that I desperately try to remove before it slips back into me (slug — leg, earthworm - palm).

Older dream: Slug — single body, with a shell outside. When removing — hesitated, got scared it's a part of me, my own nerve or something. Let it slide back into it’s tunnel under my skin.

Newer dream: Worm — when broken, each part reanimated as a new entity. No hesitation this time. Removed almost all of it, but seems a tiny peace remained inside.

Progress, I think.
